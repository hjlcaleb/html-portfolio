<h1>Caleb's Favorite Movies</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time (in no particular order)</h2>
<hr>

<h3>1. Crazy Rich Asians </h3>
<p>Very funny movie</p>

<h3>2. Saving Private Ryan</h3>
<p>Sad but inspirational movie, make sure to skip the Upham/Mellish scene</p>

<h3>3. La La Land</h3>
<p>Also sad but a realistic and good plot. Stop watching when there's 9 minutes left.</p>
